#a program to help solve the newyork-times game Strands

#strandbot1:
#-Currently, board must be manually entered in the code in the list named 'board'
#-We solve the strands game by filtering out a list of all possible words and then checking if each is available as a chain in the board
#-Since many words may be present but not the ones the game is looking for, we can say yes to the program if it is the right word and help it filter and find the rest
#-The word list is from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt but this list contains several un-necessary words for the game so if a smaller list of words is found,it can be used instead by tweaking just the file source line in the code
#-Code commented as much as possible within the .py code file
